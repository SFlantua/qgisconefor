description=This plugin integrates the Conefor landscape conectivity
    analysis software with QGIS.

about=Conefor is a software that provides tools for studying landscape
    conectivity. It features a command line version that is available for
    Windows, Mac OS and Linux. It can be downloaded from

    http://conefor.org

    This plugin integrates Conefor with QGIS. It can be used in two modes:

    * A plugin dialog with a custom GUI that can be used to generate the
      input files needed in order to run Conefor analysis. These files can
      then be used to run Conefor externally and perform the study.

    * A set of Processing algorithms that can be used to work with Conefor
      inside QGIS. It provides algorithms for both preparing Conefor inputs
      (the same functionality as available in the plugin's dialog) and also
      for running most of Conefor's algorithms. This makes it possible to
      create Processing models and scripts that efectively enable a user to
      use QGIS as a frontend to interact with Conefor.
